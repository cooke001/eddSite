    <h1>Hi All</h1>
    
    <p>This website is somewhat under construction.</p>
    <p>Eventually it'll show you some of my current projects.</p>
    <p>Currently it just shows you that i've managed to get the header and footer to work responsively on mobile devices and desktops.</p>
    <p>The hosting service for my old site went down a few years ago so I figured this would be a good opportunity to rebuild one from the ground up!</p>
    <p>If you want to see some of my other projects, have a nosey on my instagram or GitHub.</p>
    <p>The next many lines are just to test when a page is longer than 1 window size, and to check whether it all behaves.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/edwardcooke1/">Instagram</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/cooke001">GitHub</a></p>
    <p>Hmm. These links will look better in the footer, I guess...</p>
